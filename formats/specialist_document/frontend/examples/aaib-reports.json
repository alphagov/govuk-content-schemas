The pilot responded by re-positioning the control stick fully aft and the rotors struck the tailplane.  The pilot lost directional control and the right landing gear subsequently failed, causing the gyroplane to tip onto its right side.  The pilot was uninjured.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"download-report\">Download report:</h3>\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/559e25de40f0b61564000039/Rotorsport_UK_Calidus_G-PCPC_07-15.pdf\">Rotorsport UK Calidus G-PCPC 07-15</a> </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"download-glossary-of-abbreviations\">Download glossary of abbreviations:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/433812/Glossary_of_abbreviations.pdf\">Glossary of abbreviations</a></p>\n\n",
