    "body": "<h2 id=\"how-much-will-be-paid\">How much will be paid</h2>\n\n<p>£511 per hectare (ha).</p>\n\n<p>If this option is used to meet Ecological Focus Area (EFA) requirements for the Basic Payments Scheme (BPS), the payment rate is reduced because of double funding to £107 per ha.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-the-option-is-available\">Where the option is available</h2>\n\n<p>This is a rotational, whole or part parcel option. This option is available for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Mid Tier</li>\n  <li>Higher Tier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It can only be used on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>arable land</li>\n  <li>temporary grass</li>\n  <li>bush orchards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-this-option-cant-be-used\">When this option can’t be used</h3>\n\n<p>This option can&rsquo;t be used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>where evidence or records exist for important arable plants (Plantlife IAPA classification 4 and above) - these can either be historic (within the last 40 years) or from recent arable plant survey results</li>\n  <li>on organic land or on land in conversion to organic status</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-apply\">How to apply</h2>\n\n<p>Applicants can read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship\">Countryside Stewardship guidance</a> for more on eligibility and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship/how-to-apply\">how to apply</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-this-option-will-benefit-the-environment\">How this option will benefit the environment</h2>\n\n<p>This option provides areas of flowering plants to boost essential food sources for beneficial pollinators. </p>\n\n<p>If successful there will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an abundant supply of pollen and nectar-rich flowers between early and late summer </li>\n  <li>pollinating insects such as bumblebees, solitary bees, butterflies and hoverflies using the flowers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"higher-tier-agreements\">Higher Tier agreements</h3>\n\n<p>The requirements may differ slightly for a Higher Tier agreement as the option will be tailored to the site. Applicants should discuss and agree these requirements with their adviser.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"on-the-land\">On the land</h3>\n<p>Successful applicants will need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>establish a mix of at least 4 nectar-rich plants and at least 2 perennials </li>\n  <li>establish the mix in blocks or strips between 15 March and 30 April or 15 July to 30 August</li>\n  <li>rotationally cut 50% of the plot area each year between 15 April and 31 May - don’t cut the same area in successive years</li>\n  <li>cut the whole area between 15 September and 30 March, removing or shredding cuttings to avoid patches of dead material developing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"keeping-records\">Keeping records</h3>\n\n<p>Successful applicants will need to keep the following records and supply them on request:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>photographs of the established mixture and seed invoices – submit these with the annual claim</li>\n  <li>stock records to show grazing activity on parcels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-must-not-be-done\">What must not be done</h2>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t graze between 15 March and 31 August.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-this-option\">How to carry out this option</h2>\n\n<p>The following section gives advice on carrying out this option successfully but does not form part of the requirements for this option.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pick-the-right-location\">Pick the right location</h3>\n\n<p>Use lower-yielding areas if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have a sunny aspect</li>\n  <li>face south or south-southwest</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Avoid planting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>under overhanging trees</li>\n  <li>next to tall hedges</li>\n  <li>on land facing north or east</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Leave access to surrounding crops for in-season management.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"block-and-plot-sizes\">Block and plot sizes</h3>\n\n<p>Use wide margins and big blocks between 0.25ha and 0.5ha. This lets insects move to safety when bordering fields are being sprayed.</p>\n\n<p>Spacing five 0.5ha patches evenly within 100ha meets the food needs of many pollinators. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-to-sow\">What to sow</h3>\n\n<p>The seed mix used should contain both short-term nectar rich and perennial plants, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>early and late flowering red clovers</li>\n  <li>alsike clover </li>\n  <li>sainfoin </li>\n  <li>birdsfoot trefoil </li>\n  <li>black knapweed </li>\n  <li>musk mallow</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sow at 12kg per ha to provide enough plants.  </p>\n\n<p>Avoid short-term mixes that don’t include knapweed or mallow as they won’t supply pollinators with long-term food sources for years 4 and 5 of the agreement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-to-sow\">When to sow</h3>\n\n<p>Establish the mix in spring or autumn of year 1 of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Stop sowing by mid-September to avoid slug and frost damage as this tends to happen more often in later sown mixes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-sow\">How to sow</h3>\n\n<p>Sow by broadcasting seeds rather than drilling, when the soil is warm and moist. Use a ring roll before and after sowing. Check regularly for slug damage. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"management\">Management</h3>\n\n<p>Cut emerging flowers and weeds at least 2 times in year 1 and up to 4 times if necessary, where the soil is particularly fertile. Regular cutting prevents weeds smothering the slow-growing flowers so all sown species are established successfully. </p>\n\n<p>Plots can be grazed between 1 September and 30 March but there must not be any:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>poaching or soil compaction by livestock</li>\n  <li>supplementary feeding carried out</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep nectar plots until the end of the agreement. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p>Order the ‘Growing farm wildlife’ DVD from Natural England which gives a step-by-step approach to sowing nectar flower mixtures. </p>\n",
