Given issues with language and that the detainee’s’ families live in Hong Kong rather than the UK, consular staff in the British Consulate-General Hong Kong help to offer support to these detainees. This can include sending money to the arrested person from their families, sending messages between the arrested person and their families, assisting with translation issues or helping them apply for a prisoner transfer to Hong Kong where possible.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Japan prison\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/58737/Japan_prison_161128_ed.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Continuing our commitment to providing excellence in consular assistance, the consular team in Hong Kong undertakes annual visits to those posts which have a significant number of BN(O) prisoners in the region.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Psychiatric clinic in Philippines\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/58735/Psychiatric_clinic_Philippines_161128.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This annual round of visits to Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan has just been completed, covering around 40 prisoners.
