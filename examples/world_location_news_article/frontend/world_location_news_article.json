    "body": "<div class=\"govspeak\">\n<p>The Chevening Secretariat is pleased to announce the Chevening/British Library Fellowship for the 2016/2017 academic year. This is a brand new Award for the 2016/2017 cycle and we are pleased to be able to offer up to 2 awards. Chevening British Library Fellows will undertake a 12-month period of independent study and research at the British Library in London.</p>\n\n<p>There are two distinct Fellowship opportunities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>News and Media in South Asia</li>\n <li>Big Data and Libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both opportunities are available to countries in South Asia and Africa. More detail about each opportunity is available in the attached briefing notes.</p>\n\n<p><span id=\"attachment_1295654\" class=\"attachment-inline\">\n <a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479264/Chevening_Pilot_Year_-_Theme_1_South_Asia_News_Strategy_edited_and_brand....pdf\">Theme 1</a>\n (<span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">42KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">1 page</span>)\n</span></p>\n\n<p><span id=\"attachment_1295655\" class=\"attachment-inline\">\n <a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479265/Chevening_Pilot_Year_-_Theme_2_Big_data_and_libraries_edited_and_branded...-2.pdf\">Theme 2</a>\n (<span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">42.1KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">2 pages</span>)\n</span></p>\n\n<p>Applications are now open and all applications must be submitted by midday GMT on 10 February 2016</p>\n\n<p>As a fellowship programme the eligibility requirements differ slightly from the main Master’s scholarships in that a minimum of 5 years of work experience is required for applicants. Chevening Scholarship alumni may apply for the Fellowship, but must ensure there is a five year gap between receiving a Chevening Scholarship. Applicants must hold a post graduate degree or have equivalent professional training and/or experience. Applicants will need to apply using the online application system on the website and should not apply to the British Library directly. Please note that applicants can only make one application and so cannot be considered for both a British Library fellowship as well as a Master’s scholarship.</p>\n\n<p>As with the core Chevening Scheme this fellowship is an open competition. Applications from eligible countries will be assessed against each other by an independent panel and the top application for each topic received will be awarded. Post will be provided with a long list of applicants from which to select their shortlist to interview alongside the core Chevening Master’s scholars. The British Library will review all selected applicants and may host a second round of interviews via Skype to make the final selections. Successful applicants will be sent provisional selection or unsuccessful letters along with the successful core scholars before they commence their placement in September 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Please circulate this information to relevant colleagues and let me know if you have any questions. As ever I am happy to receive examples of marketing initiatives to share amongst relevant posts as examples of best practice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"africa\">Africa</h3>\n\n<p>Algeria; Angola; Benin; Botswana; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Central African Republic; Chad; Comoros; Democratic Republic of Congo; Djibouti; Egypt; Equatorial Guinea; Ethiopia; Gabon; Ghana; Guinea; Guinea Bissau; Kenya; Lesotho; Liberia; Libya; Madagascar; Malawi; Mauritania; Mauritius; Morocco; Mozambique; Namibia; Nigeria; Rwanda; Sao Tome and Principe; Senegal; Sierra Leone; Somalia; South Africa; South Sudan; Sudan; Swaziland; Tanzania; The Gambia; Togo; Tunisia; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe</p>\n</div>",
